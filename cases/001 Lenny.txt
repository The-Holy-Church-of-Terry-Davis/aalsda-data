The uniqueness of this case is like no other. No case, past, present, nor future will be as peculiar as the case of Lenny.
The formation of AALSDA is soley due to the fact of Lenny's intrigueing existant, and this formation being entirely dependent on Lenny's activity on Polar Express 2: New Generation.
